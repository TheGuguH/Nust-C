Nust C is a C-like, mid-level, general-purpose programming language with an emphasis on security and flexibility while maintaining high performance. It is strongly typed, and its paradigms are structured and functional.

Nust C has influence mainly on C, but there is a great influence of Rust on security issues.

This *README.md* contains basic information about the language (you can find more information about it on the Wiki in the GitHub repository), but its main focus is on the NCT (Nust C Compiler Tool), its characteristics, operation and use.

# NCT

## How to install

NCT was made with cross-platform in mind, that is, it works between platforms, so each operating system will have a different installation, so follow the instructions correctly.

### Linux

To install on Linux, use the following command:

´´´bash
curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/0GuguH9/Nust-C/master/install/linux.sh | bash
´´´

And after this, you can use the **nct** command everywhere.
