Nust C is a simple, education-proposite low-level language. Its a C-like language with basic library (math functions, basic console write/read functions).

This project is for educational purposes, providing a practical example of compiler development, from front-end to assembly generation.
The generated assembly is an x64, and if you want to transform the generated assembly into executable machine code, look for an assembler like nasm, or if you are on Linux, use the ```as``` command
